# TODOs
## Required
[*] tf-a compiles
[ ] u-boot compiles
[ ] kernel compiles
[ ] sd image generated
[ ] verify power voltages are controllable
[ ] uart4/main serial console


## Nice to Have
[ ] rename CubeMX files to generate the correct names the first time.
    [ ] looks like it refers to 157 instead of 157c, that could help in general next time I update...
